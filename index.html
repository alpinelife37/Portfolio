                  Where I started to how I arrived here... I have managed a
                  large retail store for the last 19 years with 140+ employees.
                  During that time I increased the net income 860%. While the
                  work was rewarding, the pay was very good, it didn't allow for
                  enough family time which is very important to me.

                  I have always had interest in computers and growing up I was
                  taught by my aunt how to physically build pcs starting with my
                  first processor speed of a 256 MHz. I also learned the DOS
                  commands to navigate the C:/ prompt. Later, I went to college
                  for web design and networking but never got a job in that
                  field. I'm currently enrolled at University of Oregon's coding
                  bootcamp and enjoying their learning platform. I am also
                  enrolled in a secondary school (Frontend Masters) to also grow
                  my coding profile. Hopefully between the two I can find a
                  position that is both challenging and that allows for a
                  positive home life.

                  When I'm not at school, I enjoy spending time with my wife and
                  three boys. We love the many outdoor activities that our PNW
                  has to offer including hiking, skiing, and fishing.
